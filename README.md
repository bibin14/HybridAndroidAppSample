Building an Interactive Android App with minimal android development skills for web developers using web technologies like HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript.

<h1>Introduction</h1>
WebView in Android is a wrapper around the WebKit rendering engine, and can be used to display web pages inside your application. As a developer, you can use this control to render any web page as part of your application. These pages can be local or can be consumed from the Web.

<b>The WebView as a Web Browser</b><br/>
A WebView is often used to load HTML content within a native application. The WebView enables you to embed a web browser, which does not have any chrome (browser) controls including window frames, menus, toolbars and scroll bars into your activity layout.

The WebView is capable of displaying online or offline web content within its layout using HTML5, JavaScript, and CSS technologies. It also includes standard browser features like history, zooming, JavaScript, rendering CSS, and so on.

The most common implementation is to facilitate advertisement loading from remote servers. WebView often comes in handy for rendering complex UI views. One good example is the Facebook and LinkedIn applications wherein the news feed is rendered using the WebView control.
